My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4942740439">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
A person must have enough money to survive in any case. At least he/she should find himself/herself somewhere in the middle of the <b>Maslow</b> pyramid. Otherwise, the <b>amygdala</b> part of the human brain starts to sound warning sirens and takes control to survive. I'm not saying, this is the common discourse of scientists! But, the common saying of most wealthy people is that long-term happiness cannot be bought with money. I think money is necessary in the short and medium term :)

On the other hand, the happiness formula works a bit strangely for the human brain. In other words, this book says that we can be happy by deceiving our brains. So the author is trying to say that people can manage happiness hormones when they want (these hormones are <b>Serotonin, Dopamine, Oxytocin, Endorphin</b>). It's a good book, I recommend it. In particular, the author encourages people to form new habits. However, he explains that it is not easy and it <b>does not feel good</b> to gain new habits. “<u>Old habits are like asphalt roads(that is, highway) of our brains. It is difficult to process new behaviors because they are narrow pathways in the neuron forest. Unknown roads are dangerous and tiring, so we usually take the roads we know.</u>” For this reason, adopting new habits or facing our fears with courage and perseverance is essential for the medium and long-term happiness of our mammalian brain.
